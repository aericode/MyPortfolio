            <p>Hello, my name is Eric. I’m a developer focused in front-end web programming since 2019.</p><br>

            <p>My interest in programming began with game development. As a kid, I was always curious about how
            videogames were made. As a teenager, in 2008 I started to try and learn how to make my own games.</p><br>

            <p>Programming started as a hobby, and later became my profession, I got a bachelor degree in IT at UFRN in
                2020 and found in making websites and sharing my knowledge new amazing ways of creating experiences that
                people could enjoy.</p><br>
